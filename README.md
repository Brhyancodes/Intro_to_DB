# Discovering Databases: An Easy Start for Beginners

Welcome to **Discovering Databases: An Easy Start for Beginners** â€” my first step into the world of databases as part of the ALX Backend Engineering program.

## ðŸ“š Project Overview
In this project, Iâ€™m exploring the **foundational concepts** and **practical skills** needed to work effectively with databases.  
Iâ€™ll start with the basics â€” understanding what a database is and why it matters â€” and gradually build my skills to handle real-world data tasks.

By the end, I aim to:
- Explain what a database is and how it works.
- Identify the different types of databases (relational, non-relational, etc.).
- Write and execute **SQL (Structured Query Language)** commands.
- Perform **CRUD** operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Apply advanced SQL techniques for querying and managing data.

## ðŸ›  Skills Iâ€™ll Gain
- **Database Fundamentals**: Core concepts, structures, and use cases.
- **SQL Basics**: Syntax, keywords, and structure.
- **CRUD Operations**: The backbone of database interaction.
- **Advanced SQL**: Filtering, sorting, joins, and aggregate functions.
